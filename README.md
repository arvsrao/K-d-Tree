k-D Tree
============

k-D Tree Project is mainly a C++ implemenation of a k-d tree data structure. A k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.

Requires:

+ CMAKE 2.6 or greater
+ C++11 sytax used so make sure you have a compiler that will compile the latest ISO standard of C++. For this project I used GCC 4.7
